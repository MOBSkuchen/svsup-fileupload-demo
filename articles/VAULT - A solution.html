<h4>VAULT - A solution</h4>
<div><h3 class="author">by MOBSkuchen</h3><a class="back" href="/">go back</a></div>
<p><br>The reason that C has had the longevity of being a goto language for 50 years is because of its simplicity.<br>
  That's what good stuff is about, simplicity. After all, doing one thing really well is <strong>a lot</strong> better than doing a million things wrong. <br><br>
  But in my opinion, C takes that too far, sacrificing productivity and ease of use. I understand that it can't. C is the minimum of something that is human understandable, so it makes sense that it has no package manager, builtin string types and that stuff - because the CPU does not have that, so why should C?<br><br>
  C is used as a benchmark for how fast programming languages can be, but is that amount of performance really worth it when you have to malloc, strcopy, memset, memcpy, free, for the 600th time today and are at the edge.<br><br>
  Trying to create a solution to that problem is hard, probably impossible. The closest we came to it was Rust, which is glazed infinitely. For good reason. While I haven't created something perfect, or maybe even useful, VAULT is my try at a better C.<br><br>
  Trying to build the language takes a lot of time and other shit, but most importantly, a philosophy. If you don't have that, you can still create the language and be successful, but it won't be good.<br><br>
